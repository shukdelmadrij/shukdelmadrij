PLG_AUTOTWEETPOST_DESC="<p>Extension plugin for AutoTweet. Inserts new/modified Post in the AutoTweet message queue. Needs AutoTweet NG Component to work!</p><p>About AutoTweet - Post: the old Manual Messages did't follow the common workflow, they were just sent to the channels. Now, they follow the general workflow. So, they have their own plugin, they can begin as a Request, be proccesed as a Post, have rules, and everything.</p>"
